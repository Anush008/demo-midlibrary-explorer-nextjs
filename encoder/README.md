## Description

This directory contains files used to create a Qdrant collection from the Midjourney dataset.

You can use the [snapshot](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-midlibrary-explorer-nextjs?tab=readme-ov-file#prepare-qdrant-collection) to set up the collection without having to generate the embeddings again.
